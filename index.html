            <p>My favorite soccer team is Manchester City! I have been a fan since I was 6, and my favorite player is Kevin De Bruyne. I currently play for the Kansas City Legends, but have also played for Arson FC as well as Sporting Blue Valley. I have played a bit of every position, but have mainly stuck with any outside position. I do primarily play wing-back, but I also have the attacking capabilities to be a outside midfielder or a winger.</p>
